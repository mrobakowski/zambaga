# Zambaga - look mum, derive macros with no extra crates!

Library inspired by [Magnolia](https://github.com/softwaremill/magnolia) for terser and easier automatic derivation of traits.

## Name
Zambaga is the Mongolian word for "magnolia" (the tree).

## How do I even?
This crate is in early stages of development. For now check out the examples in the [multicrate-example](multicrate-example) directory.

## License
Zambaga is licensed under the MIT license. (unless this version somehow uses dependencies which forbid that... TODO: check that)
